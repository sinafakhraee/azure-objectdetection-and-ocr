## License Plate Detection and Recognition using Azure Cognitive Services: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection">Object Detection API</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr">Optical Character Recognication API</a> 
This repo contains sample code showing how to train an object detection model to detect licence plates within an image. You would need to provide normalized coordinates indicating the location of the license plates for the training code.
